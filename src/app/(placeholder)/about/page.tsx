        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          CFIPros was founded by a team of experienced flight instructors and software developers
          who identified a critical gap in the tools available for flight training professionals.
          After years of using outdated systems and manually tracking student progress, we set out
          to build a modern platform that brings data-driven insights to flight instruction.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to empower Certified Flight Instructors with innovative tools and analytics
          that improve training outcomes, enhance safety, and build a more efficient flight training
          ecosystem.
        </p>

          <blockquote className="text-xl italic border-l-4 pl-4 border-primary">
            &quot;We believe that better instructors create better pilots, and better pilots make
            aviation safer for everyone. Our platform is built to support the instructors who make
            that possible.&quot;
