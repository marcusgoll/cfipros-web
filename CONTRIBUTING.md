# Contributing to CFIPros

We're excited that you're interested in contributing to CFIPros! This document outlines our guidelines for contributions, including our Git workflow, commit message conventions, and pull request process.

## ü§ù Code of Conduct

While we don't have a formal Code of Conduct document yet, we expect all contributors to interact respectfully and constructively. Please be mindful of others and help create a positive and welcoming environment for everyone.

## üå≥ Git Branching Strategy

We follow a Gitflow-like branching model with some simplifications suitable for our project size and team.

-   **`main`**: This branch represents the latest production-ready code. All direct commits to `main` are forbidden. Merges to `main` happen only from the `develop` branch after thorough testing and represent a new release.
-   **`develop`**: This is the primary development branch. All feature branches are created from `develop` and merged back into `develop`. This branch should always be stable enough for internal testing and represent the latest delivered development changes for the next release.
-   **`feature/<feature-name>`**: Feature branches are used for developing new features or significant changes. They should be branched off `develop`.
    -   Example: `feature/user-authentication`, `feature/faa-test-parser`
    -   Use kebab-case for branch names (e.g., `feature/new-dashboard-widget`).
-   **`bugfix/<bug-description>`**: For fixing bugs found in `develop` or `main`. Branched from `develop` (for upcoming release bugs) or `main` (for hotfixes to production).
    -   Example: `bugfix/login-redirect-issue`
-   **`hotfix/<hotfix-description>`**: Used for critical production bugs that need immediate attention. Branched from `main` and, once fixed and tested, merged back into both `main` and `develop`.

**General Branching Rules:**

-   Always pull the latest changes from `develop` (or `main` for hotfixes) before creating a new branch.
-   Keep your branches focused on a single feature or bug fix.
-   Delete your feature/bugfix branches after they have been merged.

## üí¨ Commit Message Conventions

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This helps in automating changelog generation and makes the commit history more readable.

The commit message format is:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Common Types:**

-   `feat`: A new feature for the user.
-   `fix`: A bug fix for the user.
-   `docs`: Documentation only changes.
-   `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
-   `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
-   `perf`: A code change that improves performance.
-   `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
-   `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm).
-   `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs).
-   `chore`: Other changes that don't modify `src` or `test` files (e.g., updating dependencies, releasing a version).

**Example Commit Messages:**

```
feat: allow users to upload PDF knowledge tests

This commit introduces the functionality for users to upload their FAA knowledge test results in PDF format. Includes backend processing and UI elements.
```

```
fix(auth): correct redirect loop on invalid login

Resolves an issue where users were stuck in a redirect loop if they entered incorrect credentials.

Closes #123
```

```
docs: update README with setup instructions
```

## üöÄ Pull Request (PR) Process

1.  **Create a Feature/Bugfix Branch:** Branch off `develop` (or `main` for hotfixes) as described in the Git Branching Strategy.
2.  **Implement Changes:** Make your code changes, adhering to our [Coding Standards](docs/coding-standards.md).
3.  **Write Tests:** Add appropriate unit, integration, or E2E tests for your changes. Ensure all tests pass.
4.  **Commit Changes:** Follow the Commit Message Conventions.
5.  **Push Your Branch:** Push your feature/bugfix branch to the remote repository.
6.  **Create a Pull Request:**
    -   Open a PR from your branch to the `develop` branch (or `main` for hotfixes).
    -   Use the PR template provided (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`). Fill it out completely.
    -   Clearly describe the changes made and the problem solved.
    -   Link any relevant issues (e.g., `Closes #issue-number`).
7.  **Code Review:** At least one other team member (or designated reviewer) will review your PR.
    -   Address any feedback or comments promptly.
    -   Push further commits to your branch to address feedback; the PR will update automatically.
8.  **Merge PR:** Once the PR is approved and all checks pass, it will be merged by a maintainer.
    -   Prefer squash and merge or rebase and merge to keep the `develop` history clean, though this can be decided on a per-PR basis.

**PR Expectations:**

-   PRs should be focused and not too large. Break down large features into smaller, manageable PRs.
-   Ensure your PR passes all automated checks (linters, tests, CI builds).
-   Provide clear and concise descriptions and test steps.
-   Be responsive to review comments.

## üíÖ Code Style and Standards

All contributions should adhere to the project's coding standards, which are documented in `docs/coding-standards.md`. This includes guidelines on formatting, naming conventions, and best practices.

We use Prettier for automated code formatting and ESLint for linting to maintain consistency.

## üëÄ Review Process

-   Reviewers will check for correctness, adherence to standards, test coverage, and overall quality.
-   Constructive feedback is encouraged. The goal is to improve the codebase and learn together.
-   Reviewers should aim to provide timely feedback.
-   Once all concerns are addressed and the PR is approved, it can be merged.
