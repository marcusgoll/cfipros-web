-- Migration: Initial schema setup
-- Created: 2025-05-10
-- Description: This migration initializes the base database schema for the CFIPros application.
-- NOTE: In a real implementation, the contents of this file would be generated with
-- 'supabase db diff' or copied from scripts/migrations/init-migration.sql.

-- For brevity in this example, we're just showing a placeholder comment.
-- The actual migration would contain all the DDL statements for:
--   - Enumerated types
--   - Tables (profiles, schools, acs_codes, etc.)
--   - Indexes
--   - Triggers
--   - Row level security policies

-- See scripts/migrations/init-migration.sql for the full schema definition
-- that would be included in this file for a real migration.

-- Note: For the first migration, we would include the complete schema captured in
-- scripts/migrations/init-migration.sql. Future migrations would only include changes
-- to this initial schema.

-- Actual migration SQL statements would go here...
