# Epic 1: Core Platform Setup & User Management

**Epic Number:** 1
**Title:** Core Platform Setup & User Management
**Status:** To Do
**Priority:** Critical
**Product Owner:** TBD
**Assigned Team:** TBD
**Sprint Allocation:** Sprint 1-2 (Estimate)

**Goal:** Establish the foundational application infrastructure, including database schema, user authentication (Student, CFI, School Admin roles), basic profile management, and landing page, enabling users to register and manage their accounts.

**Description:**
This epic covers all foundational work to get the CFIPros application off the ground. It includes setting up the Next.js project, integrating with Supabase for backend services (database and authentication), defining the core data models for users, and implementing the complete user registration, login, and basic profile management functionalities for all three user roles (Student, CFI, Flight School Administrator). It also includes creating the initial marketing/landing page to attract users and setting up email services for account-related communications.

| E1-S17   | As a Developer, I want to establish conventions for shared UI components (using shadcn/ui) and set up basic project structure for them, so UI development is consistent.                             | - Project directory structure for shared/reusable UI components (e.g., `src/components/shared` or `src/components/ui`) is defined as per `docs/project-structure.md`.\<br\>- Conventions for creating and styling shared components (leveraging shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS utility classes) are documented (e.g., in `coding-standards.md` or a `CONTRIBUTING.md` section).\<br\>- Basic `shadcn/ui` setup (e.g. `components.json`, theme configuration) is completed and any initial global styles are defined.            | High     | 2 SP     | To Do  | E1-S1        | Addresses PO feedback on shared UI component strategy.                               |

**Out of Scope for this Epic:**

- Detailed dashboard implementations (placeholders are fine).
- Subscription processing.
- Any FAA test processing functionality.
- Advanced profile settings beyond name, email, password.

**Assumptions:**

- Supabase is the chosen BaaS for authentication and database.
- Resend is the chosen email provider.
- UI/UX mockups/guidelines for landing page and auth forms will be available.

**Risks:**

- Complexity in setting up role-based access correctly in Supabase.
- Delays if UI/UX guidelines are not ready.

**Dependencies:**

- UI/UX designs for landing page and auth screens.
- Access to Supabase and Resend accounts/API keys.

**Metrics for Success:**

- Users can successfully sign up, verify email, log in, and manage basic profile information.
- Landing page effectively communicates value proposition.
- Core infrastructure is stable and ready for feature development.
