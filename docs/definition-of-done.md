# Definition of Done (DoD) Standards

## 1. Purpose of Definition of Done

The Definition of Done (DoD) is a shared understanding within the team of what it means for a piece of work (specifically a User Story) to be complete. Adhering to the DoD ensures a consistent level of quality, reduces ambiguity, and facilitates smoother handoffs and integration.

A story is "Done" when it meets all the criteria outlined below. This means it is well-understood, developed, tested, documented, and ready for integration or delivery without further work.

## 2. General Principles for a "Done" Story

* **Clarity & Completeness:** The story's intent, scope, and requirements are clear, unambiguous, and fully documented.
* **Value Delivery:** The story delivers demonstrable value to the user or the system.
* **Testability:** All aspects of the story are testable, and tests have been defined and ideally automated.
* **Adherence to Standards:** The implementation conforms to all relevant project standards (coding, architecture, UI/UX, security).
* **Independence (where feasible):** The story can be developed and tested with minimal dependencies on other incomplete stories (following the INVEST principle).
* **Readiness for Integration:** The completed story is ready to be integrated into the main codebase or deployed.

## 3. Story DoD Checklist

For a story to be marked as "Done," it must satisfy the following criteria. These should be explicitly verified during the story development and review process.

### 3.1. Requirements & Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] **Clear User Story:** The user story (or goal) is well-defined and understood.
* [ ] **Comprehensive Requirements:** All functional and non-functional requirements for the story are documented.
* [ ] **INVEST Principles for ACs:** Acceptance Criteria (ACs) are:
    * [ ] **I**ndependent: ACs can be tested separately where possible.
    * [ ] **N**egotiable: ACs are not a strict contract but a basis for discussion.
    * [ ] **V**aluable: Each AC contributes to the overall value of the story.
    * [ ] **E**stimable: The effort to meet each AC can be reasonably estimated.
    * [ ] **S**mall: ACs are granular enough to be easily understood and tested.
    * [ ] **T**estable: Each AC is verifiable with clear pass/fail conditions.
* [ ] **No Ambiguity:** Requirements and ACs are free from ambiguous language.
* [ ] **Edge Cases Considered:** Potential edge cases and error conditions relevant to the story have been identified and addressed in requirements or ACs.

### 3.2. Design & Implementation

* [ ] **Architectural Alignment:** Implementation aligns with the documented project architecture (`docs/architecture.md`).
* [ ] **Tech Stack Adherence:** Uses approved technologies and versions as per `docs/tech-stack.md`.
* [ ] **Coding Standards Met:** Code adheres to `docs/coding-standards.md` (e.g., naming conventions, style, comments).
* [ ] **Code Complexity:** Code is kept as simple as possible; complex sections are well-commented and justified.
* [ ] **Reusability:** Common functionalities are implemented in a reusable manner where appropriate.
* [ ] **Configuration Management:** Any new configurations (e.g., environment variables from `docs/environment-vars.md`) are documented and handled correctly.
* [ ] **Security Considerations:** Basic security best practices relevant to the story have been implemented (e.g., input validation, proper error handling).
* [ ] **No Hardcoding:** Sensitive information or configurable parameters are not hardcoded.
* [ ] **API/Data Model Adherence:** Follows `docs/api-reference.md` and `docs/data-models.md` where applicable.

### 3.3. Testing & Verification

* [ ] **Test Plan Alignment:** Testing activities align with `docs/testing-strategy.md`.
* [ ] **Unit Tests Written & Passing:** Comprehensive unit tests cover new/modified code, achieving agreed-upon code coverage targets. All unit tests pass.
* [ ] **Integration Tests Written & Passing (if applicable):** Integration tests verify interactions with other components or services. All relevant integration tests pass.
* [ ] **Manual Test Cases Documented (if automation is not feasible):** Clear steps for manual verification are documented if automated tests are not practical for certain ACs.
* [ ] **Successful Manual Verification (if applicable):** All manual test cases pass.
* [ ] **ACs Verified:** All Acceptance Criteria have been met and demonstrated/verified.
* [ ] **Automated Verification Goals:** Where possible, tests are automated to support CI/CD and regression testing. The story prompts for or includes these automated tests.
* [ ] **Peer Review/Code Review Completed:** Code has been reviewed by at least one other team member (or an AI peer reviewer agent) and feedback has been addressed.

### 3.4. Documentation & Handover

* [ ] **Inline Code Comments:** Code is adequately commented, especially complex logic.
* [ ] **Story Documentation Updated:** The story file itself (e.g., `ai/stories/#.#.story.md`) is updated with any implementation notes, deviations, or decisions made during development.
* [ ] **Relevant Project Docs Updated (if necessary):** If the story implementation necessitates changes or additions to `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/project-structure.md`, etc., these changes are noted or a separate task is created.
* [ ] **Knowledge Transfer (if applicable):** Necessary information is shared with the team if the story introduces new patterns, technologies, or complex logic.

### 3.5. Story Management

* [ ] **Story Status Updated:** The story is marked as "Done" in the tracking system.
* [ ] **Deviations Documented:** Any deviations from the original plan or epic are documented within the story file.

## 4. Automated Verification Support

* Where feasible, the Definition of Done should be supported by automated checks:
    * Linters and static code analyzers for coding standards.
    * Automated test execution (unit, integration) in CI pipelines.
    * Code coverage reports.
* Stories should be written to facilitate the creation of these automated checks.

This Definition of Done is a living document and may be updated as the project evolves and the team refines its processes.
