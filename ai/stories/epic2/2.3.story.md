# Story 2.3: ACS Code Database Creation and Population

**Status:** In-Progress

**DoD Reference:** All aspects of this story must adhere to the standards outlined in `docs/definition-of-done.md`.

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want to create and populate an ACS (Airman Certification Standards) code database, so that extracted codes can be matched and described.

**Context:** This story is foundational for the FAA Knowledge Test Extraction Tool (Epic 2). After files are uploaded (Story 2.1) and OCR is performed (Story 2.2), the system needs a structured database of ACS codes to match against the extracted information from test reports. This database will provide the descriptions and categorizations for each ACS code, enabling users to understand their performance.

## Detailed Requirements

Copied from `docs/epic2.md` (E2-S3):
As a Developer, I want to create and populate an ACS (Airman Certification Standards) code database, so that extracted codes can be matched and described.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

Copied from `docs/epic2.md` (E2-S3):

- AC1: A database table named `acs_codes` is created in Supabase with appropriate fields including `id` (primary key, text for the code itself like "CA.I.A.K1"), `description` (text), `area` (text, nullable), `task` (text, nullable), `sub_task` (text, nullable), `knowledge_area` (text, nullable), and `exam_type` (text, e.g., "CAX", "PAR", "IRA"). **Verified: Table created by migration, schema confirmed.**
- AC2: A clear source for ACS codes is identified (e.g., official FAA ACS PDF documents or structured data if available), and the initial data for relevant test types (e.g., PAR, CAX, IRA) is imported/entered into the `acs_codes` table. **Verified: User provided structured data files; data seeded into table.**
- AC3: A script or documented manual process is established for populating and potentially updating the `acs_codes` table. For MVP, a one-time seeding script is sufficient for initial population, and manual updates via SQL or Supabase Studio are acceptable for changes. **Verified: `scripts/seed-acs-codes.ts` created, uses upsert for population and updates.**

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed. **All implementation details must align with `docs/definition-of-done.md` criteria.**

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create:
    - `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_acs_codes_table.sql` (SQL migration file for creating the `acs_codes` table). **Done, (user to replace YYYYMMDDHHMMSS with actual timestamp).**
    - `src/lib/acs-codes/` (Directory to store raw ACS data, e.g., `cax.ts`, `par.ts`, `ira.ts` containing arrays of `AcsCode` objects). **Done, user populated files.**
    - `scripts/seed-acs-codes.ts` (A TypeScript script to read data from `src/lib/acs-codes/` and populate the `acs_codes` table in Supabase). **Done.**
  - Files to Modify:
    - `src/lib/supabase/types.ts` (or a dedicated `src/lib/types/acs.ts`) to include/update the TypeScript interface for `AcsCode` matching the table structure. **Done, created `src/lib/types/acs.ts`.**
    - `package.json`: Add a script command to run the seeding script (e.g., `"db:seed:acs"`). **Done.**
  - _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for overall layout and `docs/data-models.md` for the `AcsCode` interface and `acs_codes` table DDL.)_

- **Key Technologies:**

  - Supabase (PostgreSQL) for the database.
  - SQL for the migration file.
  - TypeScript for the `AcsCode` interface and the seeding script.
  - Node.js environment for running the seeding script.
  - Supabase client library (`@supabase/supabase-js`) within the seeding script to interact with the database.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - The `seed-acs-codes.ts` script will use the Supabase client (likely with a service role key for write access during seeding) to insert data into the `acs_codes` table.
  - Focus on batch inserts if possible for efficiency during seeding. **Done, script uses batch upsert.**
  - _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md` for Supabase client usage patterns if needed, though direct DB interaction is primary here)_

- **UI/UX Notes:**

  - Not applicable for this backend/data-focused story.

- **Data Structures:**

  - The primary data structure is the `AcsCode` interface and the corresponding `acs_codes` table. The schema from `docs/data-models.md` should be followed:
    ```typescript
    // Example: src/lib/types/acs.ts
    export interface AcsCode {
      id: string; // e.g., "CA.I.A.K1"
      description: string;
      area: string | null;
      task: string | null;
      sub_task: string | null;
      knowledge_area: string | null;
      exam_type: string; // e.g., "CAX", "PAR", "IRA"
      // created_at and updated_at are handled by DB
    }
    ```
    The `acs_codes` table structure (from `docs/data-models.md`):
    - `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY
    - `created_at` TIMESTAMPTZ
    - `updated_at` TIMESTAMPTZ
    - `description` TEXT NOT NULL
    - `area` TEXT NULL
    - `task` TEXT NULL
    - `sub_task` TEXT NULL
    - `knowledge_area` TEXT NULL
    - `exam_type` TEXT NOT NULL
      **Schema implemented in migration.**

- **Environment Variables:**

  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Required by the `seed-acs-codes.ts` script for database write access.
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Required by the Supabase client in the script.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md` for all variables)_
    **Script uses these variables.**

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Adhere to `docs/coding-standards.md` for SQL and TypeScript.
  - The `seed-acs-codes.ts` script should be robust, with error handling and clear logging of its progress (e.g., number of records inserted per exam type). **Done.**
  - ACS data in `src/lib/acs-codes/` should be structured clearly for maintainability. **User provided.**

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Define `acs_codes` Table Schema & Create Migration**
  - [x] Finalize the schema for the `acs_codes` table based on `docs/data-models.md` and ACs.
  - [x] Create a Supabase migration file (`supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_acs_codes_table.sql`) with the DDL to create the `acs_codes` table and any necessary indexes (e.g., on `exam_type`).
  - [x] Apply the migration to the local Supabase development environment. _(User confirmed applied)_
- [x] **Task 2: Source and Structure ACS Code Data**
  - [x] Identify official FAA sources for ACS codes (e.g., ACS PDFs for Private Pilot, Commercial Pilot, Instrument Rating - PAR, CAX, IRA initially). _(User provided data based on sources)_
  - [x] Manually transcribe or parse this data into structured TypeScript arrays/objects within files like `src/lib/acs-codes/par.ts`, `src/lib/acs-codes/cax.ts`, etc., matching the `AcsCode` interface. _(User provided files)_
    - Each file should export an array of `AcsCode` objects.
- [x] **Task 3: Implement Seeding Script (`scripts/seed-acs-codes.ts`)**
  - [x] Create the `seed-acs-codes.ts` script.
  - [x] Implement logic to connect to Supabase using the JS client (with service role key).
  - [x] Read the structured ACS data from the files in `src/lib/acs-codes/`.
  - [x] Insert the data into the `acs_codes` table. Handle potential conflicts if a code `id` already exists (e.g., upsert or skip, though for initial seed, clean insert is fine). _(Upsert implemented)_
  - [x] Add logging for success/failure and number of records processed.
  - [x] Ensure the script is idempotent or clearly documented if it's for one-time seed vs. updates. _(Upsert makes it idempotent)_
- [x] **Task 4: Update Type Definitions**
  - [x] Ensure `src/lib/types/acs.ts` (or `src/lib/supabase/types.ts`) contains the accurate `AcsCode` TypeScript interface that mirrors the database table structure.
- [x] **Task 5: Add `package.json` Script**
  - [x] Add a command like `"db:seed:acs": "tsx scripts/seed-acs-codes.ts"` to `package.json`.
- [x] **Task 6: Documentation & Data Verification**
  - [x] Document the source of the ACS data used for seeding. _(User managed data sources)_
  - [x] Manually verify a sample of the seeded data in the Supabase table to ensure correctness and completeness for the initial set. _(User confirmed data is good)_
  - [x] Briefly document the process for updating ACS codes in the future (e.g., update TS files and re-run seed script, or manual SQL updates for minor changes for MVP). _(Script uses upsert for updates)_

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. **All testing must satisfy the criteria in `docs/definition-of-done.md` (section 3.3) and align with `docs/testing-strategy.md`.**

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Not directly applicable for the SQL migration file itself.
  - Unit tests for the seeding script (`scripts/seed-acs-codes.ts`) could be complex due to DB interaction. Focus on:
    - Mocking the Supabase client to test the script's logic for reading local data files and preparing data for insertion.
    - Testing any data transformation logic within the script if present.
      _(Skipped for MVP, manual verification deemed sufficient for this utility script)_
- **Integration Tests:**
  - The primary verification for this story will be through successful execution of the migration and the seeding script against a real (local or test) Supabase instance. **Done.**
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - [x] Successfully apply the `_create_acs_codes_table.sql` migration using Supabase CLI (`supabase db reset` if local, or apply migration directly).
  - [x] Run the `npm run db:seed:acs` script (or equivalent).
  - [x] Verify the script logs successful execution and the number of records inserted.
  - [x] Connect to the Supabase database (e.g., via Supabase Studio SQL Editor or `psql`).
  - [x] Confirm the `acs_codes` table exists with the correct schema (columns, types, constraints).
  - [x] Query the `acs_codes` table to verify that data for initial exam types (e.g., PAR, CAX, IRA) has been populated correctly. Check a sample of codes for accurate descriptions and other fields. _(User confirmed)_

- **Completion Notes:**
  - Created SQL migration for `acs_codes` table.
  - Developed a TypeScript seeding script (`scripts/seed-acs-codes.ts`) that reads ACS data from user-provided `.ts` files in `src/lib/acs-codes/`.
  - The script connects to Supabase, handles dynamic imports of data files, maps data (including `knowledge` field to `knowledge_area`), and uses `upsert` for idempotent data population.
  - Added duplicate ID detection within files to aid data cleaning.
  - Updated `package.json` with a `db:seed:acs` script.
  - Created `AcsCode` TypeScript interface in `src/lib/types/acs.ts`.
  - Iteratively debugged script issues related to environment variables, ES module pathing (`__dirname`, `file://` URLs), and data mapping (`exam_type`, duplicate IDs).
  - User confirmed successful script execution and data verification in Supabase.
- **Change Log:**
  - Initial Draft
  - Status: In-Progress
  - Task 1-5 completed. Script developed and refined.
  - Debugging for env vars, ESM paths, data mapping.
  - Duplicate ID detection added to script.
  - Status: Review. All tasks and verification completed.
