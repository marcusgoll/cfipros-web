# Story 1.14 Validation

## Validation Against Story Draft Checklist

### 1. GOAL & CONTEXT CLARITY

- [x] Relationship to epic goals is evident
- [x] How the story fits into overall system flow is explained
- [x] Dependencies on previous stories are identified (Story 1.3 database setup)
- [x] Business context and value are clear

### 2. REQUIREMENTS & ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- [x] Detailed requirements are copied from the epic and are unambiguous
- [x] Acceptance Criteria (ACs) are copied from the epic
- [x] **ACs are INVEST:**
    - [x] Independent (Each AC addresses a distinct aspect of the migration strategy)
    - [x] Negotiable (Provides flexibility in implementation approaches)
    - [x] Valuable (Each contributes to the overall goal of systematic schema management)
    - [x] Estimable (Clear scope for documentation tasks)
    - [x] Small (Focused on specific migration strategy components)
    - [x] Testable (Can verify documentation exists and process works)
- [x] Potential edge cases and error scenarios considered (Rollback strategy included)

### 3. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

- [x] Key files to create/modify are identified
- [x] Technologies specifically needed for this story are mentioned
- [x] Critical APIs or interfaces are sufficiently described (Supabase CLI)
- [x] Necessary data models or structures are referenced
- [x] Required environment variables are listed (N/A for this story)
- [x] Any exceptions to standard coding patterns are noted (N/A for this story)

### 4. REFERENCE EFFECTIVENESS

- [x] References to external documents point to specific relevant sections
- [x] Critical information from previous stories is summarized (mentions Story 1.3)
- [x] Context is provided for why references are relevant
- [x] References use consistent format

### 5. SELF-CONTAINMENT ASSESSMENT

- [x] Core information needed is included
- [x] Implicit assumptions are made explicit
- [x] Domain-specific terms or concepts are explained (Supabase CLI, migrations)

### 6. TESTING GUIDANCE

- [x] Required testing approach is outlined
- [x] Key test scenarios are identified for each AC
- [x] Success criteria for tests are clear
- [x] Prompts for automated verification where feasible (noted as N/A for documentation)
- [x] Special testing considerations are noted (manual verification of process execution)

### 7. DEFINITION OF DONE (DoD) COMPLIANCE

- [x] **Story Structure for DoD:** The story template is populated to address all relevant DoD criteria
- [x] **Requirements & ACs (DoD 3.1):**
    - [x] Story requirements and ACs are clear and complete
    - [x] ACs are framed to be testable and meet quality standards
- [x] **Design & Implementation Guidance (DoD 3.2):**
    - [x] Sufficient guidance is provided for adhering to architecture, tech stack, and coding standards
    - [x] Prompts for consideration of SQL best practices and migration naming conventions
- [x] **Testing & Verification Guidance (DoD 3.3):**
    - [x] Story notes that this is primarily documentation, so unit/integration tests are not applicable
    - [x] Guidance for manual tests is clear and comprehensive
    - [x] Explicitly mentions need for AC verification through manual testing
- [x] **Documentation & Handover Prompts (DoD 3.4):**
    - [x] Story includes sections for documenting the migration strategy clearly
- [x] **Automated Verification (DoD 4):**
    - [x] Story explicitly notes that automated verification is not applicable for this documentation-focused story

**Final Assessment:**

- **READY**: The story provides sufficient context for implementation and aligns with DoD. The tasks are well-defined, and the acceptance criteria are clearly testable. The developer should have all the information needed to successfully implement this story.
