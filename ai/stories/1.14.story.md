# Story 1.14: Define Database Schema Migration Strategy Using Supabase Tools

**Status:** Done

**DoD Reference:** All aspects of this story must adhere to the standards outlined in `docs/definition-of-done.md`.

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want to define and document the database schema migration strategy using Supabase tools, so that schema changes are managed systematically.

**Context:** This story focuses on establishing a clear process for managing database schema migrations in Supabase. Following the initial database setup in Story 1.3, we need a structured approach for ongoing schema changes to ensure consistency across environments and developer experiences. This is fundamental infrastructure work that will guide all future database changes throughout the project lifecycle.

## Detailed Requirements

As a Developer, I want to define and document the database schema migration strategy using Supabase tools, so that schema changes are managed systematically with:

- Strategy for creating and applying Supabase schema migrations (e.g., using Supabase CLI or UI-driven DDL) is documented (e.g., in `README.md` or a dedicated `docs/migrations.md`).
- Process for versioning migrations is defined.
- Process for applying migrations in different environments (local, staging, production) is outlined.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Strategy for creating and applying Supabase schema migrations (e.g., using Supabase CLI or UI-driven DDL) is documented (e.g., in `README.md` or a dedicated `docs/migrations.md`).
- AC2: Process for versioning migrations is defined.
- AC3: Process for applying migrations in different environments (local, staging, production) is outlined.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed. **All implementation details must align with `docs/definition-of-done.md` criteria.**

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create:
    - `docs/migrations.md` - Comprehensive documentation of the migration strategy
    - `scripts/migrations/init-migration.sql` (optional) - Initial schema script
    - `.gitignore` updates (if needed for Supabase CLI local files)
  - Files to Modify:
    - `README.md` - Add reference to migration strategy
  - _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for overall layout)_

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Supabase (PostgreSQL) - The database service used in the project
  - Supabase CLI - Command-line interface for Supabase management
  - SQL/DDL - For schema definition
  - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

- **Data Structures:**
  - Reference to database schema defined in `docs/data-models.md`
  - Migration tracking/versioning approach
  - _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md` for key project data structures)_

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow SQL best practices for any example migration scripts
  - Use clear, consistent naming for migration files
  - **Ensure all code adheres to `docs/coding-standards.md` and DoD section 3.2.**

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. **All testing must satisfy the criteria in `docs/definition-of-done.md` (section 3.3) and align with `docs/testing-strategy.md`.**

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Not applicable for documentation-only changes.

- **Integration Tests:**
  - Not applicable for documentation-only changes.

- **Manual Verification:**
  - Verify that the documented migration strategy can be successfully executed in a local development environment.
  - Test creating a new migration following the documented process.
  - Test applying a migration following the documented process.
  - Verify that the strategy has clear guidelines for all environments (local, staging, production).

- **Automated Verification:**
  - Not applicable for documentation-only changes.

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

- **Agent Model Used:** `Claude 3.7 Sonnet`
- **Completion Notes:** 
  
  I've defined and documented a comprehensive database migration strategy using Supabase CLI tools. The implementation includes:
  
  1. Created `docs/migrations.md` with detailed guidelines covering:
     - Migration workflow for all environments (local, staging, production)
     - Naming conventions and versioning strategy
     - Best practices for writing migration scripts
     - Rollback procedures
     - Troubleshooting common issues
     - Example migrations
  
  2. Established a Supabase project structure with:
     - `supabase/config.toml` for project configuration
     - `supabase/migrations/` directory with example migrations
     - `supabase/seed.sql` for initial data seeding
  
  3. Created an initial migration script (`scripts/migrations/init-migration.sql`) capturing the current database schema based on `docs/data-models.md`
  
  4. Updated the README.md to include:
     - Reference to migration documentation
     - Clear instructions for developers on applying migrations using the Supabase CLI
  
  5. Demonstrated both approaches to migrations:
     - Manual SQL script creation
     - Schema diffing for complex changes made through the Supabase UI
  
  This implementation satisfies all acceptance criteria and provides a clear, structured approach to managing database schema changes throughout the project lifecycle. The strategy emphasizes a version-controlled, collaborative approach to database changes, with safeguards for production deployments.

  **Update (Post-Review Iteration):** The initial attempt to apply the full schema via `supabase/migrations/20250510000000_initial_schema.sql` did not take effect as the CLI considered it already applied (due to earlier placeholder content). A new migration, `supabase/migrations/20250513163214_apply_full_initial_schema.sql`, was created. After troubleshooting syntax errors (removing `IF NOT EXISTS` from `CREATE TYPE` and adding `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` before `CREATE POLICY`), this new migration was successfully applied, and the full schema, including RLS policies, is now active on the connected Supabase instance.

  **Note:** There are some minor linter errors (trailing whitespace) in `README.md` that I was unable to automatically resolve. These should be addressed manually.
