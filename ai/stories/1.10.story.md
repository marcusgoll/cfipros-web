# Story 1.10: Landing/Marketing Page

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Visitor, I want to see a compelling Landing/Marketing page, so that I understand what CFIPros offers and can sign up.

**Context:** This story focuses on creating the first impression point for potential users - the Landing/Marketing page. This page will highlight the core value proposition of CFIPros, with specific sections targeting the three main user roles (Students, CFIs, and Flight School Administrators). The page will need to effectively communicate the benefits of using the platform and guide users through clear calls-to-action to register for the appropriate account type.

## Detailed Requirements

As a Visitor, I want to see a compelling Landing/Marketing page, so that I understand what CFIPros offers and can sign up.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Static page(s) developed using Next.js.
- AC2: Content outlines key features and benefits for Students, CFIs, and Schools.
- AC3: Clear Call-to-Actions (CTAs) for signup for each role.
- AC4: Professionally designed, adhering to UI/UX guidelines (calm UX, modern).
- AC5: Page is responsive.

    - `src/components/features/landing/PricingSection.tsx` (Optional: Basic pricing information)
    - `src/components/features/landing/FAQSection.tsx` (Optional: Common questions and answers)
  - Files to Modify:
    - None (this is a new standalone component)
  - _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for overall layout)_

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Next.js
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - shadcn/ui components
  - React Server Components (for static content)
  - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list and version information)_

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - The landing page should have a clean, modern design with a "calm UX" approach
  - Use soft, professional color palette
  - Ensure visual hierarchy guides users to key information and CTAs
  - Include high-quality imagery related to aviation/flight training
  - Use responsive design to ensure good experience on all devices
  - Implement smooth transitions and animations sparingly for a premium feel

- **Data Structures:**
  - No specific data models required for this page
  - May use static content objects defined within components:
    ```typescript
    interface Feature {
      id: string;
      title: string;
      description: string;
      icon?: React.ReactNode;
    }
    
    interface RoleBenefit {
      role: 'student' | 'cfi' | 'school';
      title: string;
      benefits: string[];
      ctaText: string;
      ctaLink: string;
    }
    ```

- **Environment Variables:**
  - No specific environment variables required for this component
  - _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md` for all variables)_

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Use React Server Components where possible for static content
  - Ensure all components are typed properly
  - Use semantic HTML for better accessibility
  - Implement responsive design using Tailwind's responsive classes
  - Follow BEM-like naming conventions for custom CSS classes (if any needed beyond Tailwind)
  - Ensure a11y compliance (proper contrast, alt tags for images, ARIA attributes where needed)
  - _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Completion Notes

The landing/marketing page has been implemented according to the requirements. All components were created as specified in the requirements, including:

1. A compelling hero section with clear CTAs
2. A features section highlighting key platform capabilities
3. Role-specific benefits section with tabs for different user types
4. Additional sections including testimonials, pricing, and FAQs

All components are responsive and adapt well to different screen sizes. Accessibility has been addressed by adding appropriate ARIA attributes, proper heading structure, and sufficient color contrast. The design follows a clean, modern aesthetic with a professional color palette.

The implementation follows React Server Components where possible, with client components used where interactivity is needed (tabs, accordions). The code structure is modular and allows for easy expansion in the future.
