# Story 1.13: Create Comprehensive README.md and Repository Guidelines

**Status:** Done

**DoD Reference:** All aspects of this story must adhere to the standards outlined in `docs/definition-of-done.md`.

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want a comprehensive `README.md` and defined initial repository guidelines, so that project setup and contribution are clear.

**Context:** This story focuses on creating clear documentation and guidelines for the project, which is essential for current developers and future contributors. The basic project structure was set up in Story 1.1, but now we need comprehensive documentation to ensure consistent development practices. This will include a detailed README, contribution guidelines, and a review of the existing `.gitignore` file to ensure it's appropriate for our tech stack.

## Detailed Requirements

As a Developer, I want to create a comprehensive `README.md` and define initial repository guidelines with the following elements:

1. The `README.md` should be created at the project root.
2. The README should include:
   - Project overview
   - Links to key documents (PRD, Architecture)
   - Local development setup instructions (prerequisites, environment variables, running dev server)
   - Instructions for running tests
3. Repository guidelines should include:
   - Git branching strategy (e.g., main, develop, feature/feature-name)
   - PR process (e.g., PR template, review expectations)
4. Initial `.gitignore` file should be reviewed and deemed sufficient.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: `README.md` is created at the project root with a comprehensive overview of the project.
- AC2: README includes links to key documents (PRD, Architecture).
- AC3: README includes complete local development setup instructions.
- AC4: README includes instructions for running tests.
- AC5: README includes basic contribution guidelines, including Git branching strategy.
- AC6: README includes PR process details.
- AC7: `.gitignore` file is reviewed and deemed sufficient for the project's tech stack.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed. **All implementation details must align with `docs/definition-of-done.md` criteria.**

- **Relevant Files:**

    - `.gitignore` - Review and update if necessary
  - _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for overall layout)_

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Markdown for documentation
  - GitHub-specific features (PR templates, etc.)
