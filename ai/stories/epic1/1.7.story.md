# Story 1.7: User Login Implementation

**Status:** Done

**DoD Reference:** All aspects of this story must adhere to the standards outlined in `docs/definition-of-done.md`.

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a User, I want to be able to log in to my CFIPros account, so that I can access my dashboard and features.

**Context:** This story builds upon the implementation of the core authentication infrastructure (Stories 1.1-1.3) and the various user role registration flows (Stories 1.4-1.6). With user accounts now being created in the system, this story focuses on implementing the login functionality to allow registered users to authenticate and access their respective dashboards based on their role.

## Detailed Requirements

As a User, I want to be able to log in to my CFIPros account, so that I can access my dashboard and features.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Login form available with Email and Password fields.
- AC2: Successful authentication redirects user to their respective dashboard.
- AC3: Secure session management implemented (e.g., using Supabase Auth).
- AC4: "Forgot Password" link available (functionality in a later story if complex).
- AC5: Appropriate error handling for invalid credentials, unverified email, etc.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed. **All implementation details must align with `docs/definition-of-done.md` criteria.**

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create:
    - `src/app/login/page.tsx` (Main login page)
    - `src/components/features/auth/LoginForm.tsx` (Login form component)
  - Files to Modify:
    - `src/lib/supabase/auth.ts` (To add login-specific functionality if needed)
    - `src/app/page.tsx` (To add links to login page)
    - `src/middleware.ts` (To implement route protection for authenticated routes)
  - _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for overall layout)_

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Next.js (App Router)
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Supabase Auth
  - shadcn/ui components
  - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Use Supabase Auth API for user authentication: `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()`
  - Handle session management with Supabase Auth
  - Implement Next.js middleware for route protection
  - _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md` for details on external APIs and SDKs)_

- **Data Structures:**
  - **LoginFormData**:
    - `email`: string
    - `password`: string
  
  - **User/Profile**:
    - Uses Supabase `auth.users` table for authentication
    - Uses `profiles` table to retrieve user role and additional information
  
  - _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md` for complete data structure details)_

- **Environment Variables:**
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous key
  - _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md` for all variables)_

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Use React Hook Form with Zod for form validation
  - Implement proper error handling and user feedback
  - Follow the established component structure from the registration flows
  - Use shadcn/ui components for consistent styling
  - Implement responsive design for mobile compatibility
  - _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. **All testing must satisfy the criteria in `docs/definition-of-done.md` (section 3.3) and align with `docs/testing-strategy.md`.**

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test the login form component validation logic
  - Test the login form submission handler
  - Test the OAuth providers for login functionality
  - Test the route protection middleware

- **Integration Tests:**
