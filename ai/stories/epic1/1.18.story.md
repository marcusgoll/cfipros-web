# Story: Feature Flag System

As a Developer, I want to implement a feature flag system, so that incomplete features can be safely deployed and enabled/disabled as needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Feature flag library/system selected and integrated
- Helper functions created to check feature flag status in both server and client components
- Documentation on how to use feature flags in the codebase
- At least one example feature flag implemented for demonstration
- Admin interface or configuration file for toggling feature flags in different environments

## Technical Context

We need a lightweight feature flag system that allows us to:
1. Control feature availability across environments
2. Toggle features without redeployment
3. Support both server and client-side feature checks

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] Research and select appropriate feature flag approach (simple env vars with fallbacks for MVP)
- [x] Create `src/lib/feature-flags` directory with core implementation
- [x] Implement helper hooks and utilities for checking flags
- [x] Document usage patterns in README
- [x] Create example implementation for signup flow transition
- [x] Add feature flag for unified vs. role-specific signup flows

## Definition of Done

- Feature flag system is implemented and documented
- At least one feature flag is operational
- Both server and client components can check feature status
- Documentation provides clear usage examples
