# Story: Basic Analytics Tracking

As a Developer, I want to set up basic analytics tracking, so that we can gather user behavior data from day one.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Select and integrate an analytics solution (PostHog)
- Implement page view tracking for key pages (landing, signup, login, dashboard)
- Configure event tracking for critical user actions (signup, login, role selection, subscription view)
- Ensure analytics respects user privacy and complies with regulations
- Create a simple dashboard or reporting mechanism for tracking key metrics

## Technical Context

We need to implement analytics to:
1. Understand user behavior
2. Track conversion paths 
3. Identify UX bottlenecks
4. Measure feature adoption

PostHog is the selected solution due to its open-source nature, self-hosting options, and privacy features.

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] Create PostHog account and get API keys
- [x] Implement PostHog SDK in the application
- [x] Create analytics provider with common event types
- [x] Add page view tracking to key pages
- [x] Add event tracking for critical user actions
- [x] Document event taxonomy for team reference
- [ ] Verify data is being captured correctly in PostHog dashboard

## Definition of Done

- PostHog is successfully integrated
- Page views and key events are being tracked
- Privacy requirements are met
- Documentation explains how to add new events
- Test events appear in the PostHog dashboard
