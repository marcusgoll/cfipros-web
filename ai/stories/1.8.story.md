# Story 1.8: Email Service Configuration

**Status:** Review

**DoD Reference:** All aspects of this story must adhere to the standards outlined in `docs/definition-of-done.md`.

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want to configure Supabase Auth for email management and Resend for non-auth communications, so users receive appropriate emails.

**Context:** This story builds upon the implementation of the basic user authentication system (Stories 1.1-1.3) and the user registration/login flows (Stories 1.4-1.7). With user authentication and session management in place, we now need to properly configure email communication for both authentication-related emails (handled by Supabase Auth) and other transactional emails (using Resend). This will ensure users receive important notifications like verification emails, password reset links, and other application communications.

## Detailed Requirements

As a Developer, I want to configure Supabase Auth for email management and Resend for non-auth communications, so users receive appropriate emails.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Supabase Auth configured for handling signup, verification, password reset emails.
- AC2: Email templates customized in Supabase Auth.
- AC3: Resend SDK/API integrated (but not used for auth flows).
- AC4: API keys configured securely.
- AC5: Function created for future notification emails via Resend.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed. **All implementation details must align with `docs/definition-of-done.md` criteria.**

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create:
    - `src/lib/resend/index.ts` (Resend client setup and email functions)
    - `src/services/emailService.ts` (Higher-level email service functions)
  - Files to Modify:
    - `src/lib/supabase/auth.ts` (To ensure proper email handling)
    - `.env.example` (To document required environment variables)
  - _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for overall layout)_

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Next.js
  - TypeScript
  - Supabase Auth
  - Resend
  - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Configure Supabase Auth email templates and settings via Supabase Dashboard
  - Use Resend API for non-authentication emails: `resend.emails.send()`
  - _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md` for details on external APIs and SDKs)_

- **Data Structures:**
  - **Email Template Data**:
    - `subject`: string
    - `htmlContent`: string
    - `textContent`: string (optional)
    - `to`: string or string[] (email addresses)
    - `from`: string (email address - must be verified in Resend)
    - `replyTo`: string (optional)
  
  - _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md` for complete data structure details)_

- **Environment Variables:**
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous key
  - `RESEND_API_KEY`: API key for Resend email service
  - `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`: Default sender email for Resend (must be verified)
  - _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md` for all variables)_

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Use async/await for all API calls
  - Implement proper error handling and logging
  - Follow established project structure and naming conventions
  - Create reusable functions for common email operations
  - _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_
